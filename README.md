## Getting Started

### Run Eleventy

```

Please now navigate to the following URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the site in any web browser of your choosing. (Note: if you use the hyperlink, it will open the address to your default browser. If you want to use any browser aside from default, you must enter the address manually.)

Hot reloading is enabled, so any changes you make to your files will be reflected in the browser.

### Alternative Viewing Method

The Site has also been deployed to Netlify for an easier viewing experience. If you wish, you can navigate to /*URL*/ to avoid installing and running Eleventy.

## About
 The "Awl Rights Preserved." in the footer section is a play on words for the simple fact that the website is not copyrighted by myself by any means and is a comedic placeholder for something you would see on a real site, eg. "All Rights Reserved".
