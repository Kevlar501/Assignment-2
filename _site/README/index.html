<h2>About</h2>
<p>The &quot;Awl Rights Preserved.&quot; in the footer section is a play on words for the simple fact that the website is not copyrighted by myself by any means and is a comedic placeholder for something you would see on a real site, eg. &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot;.</p>
<p>There are features that are listed on the site that are not yet available. Mainly features that require a database sytem to store and update data. Or Features that require JavaScript or other scripting language snippets to drive behavior, such as the language modifier dropdown. These features will be functional in later releases, but for the purpose of this assignment, the displayed features highlight the use of tools like Bulma.</p>
